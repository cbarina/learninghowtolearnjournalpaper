# Learning how to learn journal paper
Honors coursework for Coursera: Learning How to Learn - A5 journal paper that can be hole-punched and put in a planner. Two options: one with no quote of the day (bulk print the same page over and over, double-sided) and one with individual quotes of the day.

Quotes of the day (QOTDs) come from the coursera lectures, and are provided in a separate spreadsheet so you can edit, then do your own mail merge to generate quotes of the day on the stock version.

If you want to add more quotations and share with others, please submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/">pull request</a>, or contact me if that's too daunting and we'll figure it out, and how to give you credit :)
